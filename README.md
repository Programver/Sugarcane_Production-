# Sugarcane Production Analysis

This project analyzes global sugarcane production data using Python's data analysis libraries. It focuses on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualizations to uncover patterns and insights related to sugarcane production across different countries and continents.

## Objectives of teh project

- Clean and preprocess real-world agricultural data.
- Perform univariate and multivariate analysis.
- Visualize sugarcane production trends by country and continent.
- Identify key producers and regional patterns in production.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation
- **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** – for data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for interactive analysis

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is titled:  
**List of Countries by Sugarcane Production**  
It contains country-wise sugarcane production figures, including continent data for geographical analysis.

## Key Steps in the Project

1. **Data Loading & Inspection**
   - Loaded the dataset using `pandas`.
   - Explored the structure using `.shape`, `.head()`, and `.info()`.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed missing or irrelevant entries.
   - Handled data type conversions.

3. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Counted how many countries produce sugarcane in each continent.
   - Visualized the production distribution with bar plots and histograms.

4. **Multivariate Analysis**
   - Compared production volume across countries and continents.
   - Identified top producers and regional differences using visual tools.

## Visualizations Included

- Bar charts of sugarcane production by continent
- Histograms and box plots for distribution analysis
- Heatmaps and scatter plots for deeper multivariate insight

## Conclusion

This analysis highlights which countries and regions dominate global sugarcane production. It also showcases how EDA techniques can be applied to derive insights from agricultural data.
